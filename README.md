# SQL-Bookstore-Sales-Analysis

# üìö SQL Bookstore Sales Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This end-to-end SQL project analyzes **bookstore sales, customer trends, and inventory management** using PostgreSQL. The dataset consists of **Books, Customers, and Orders** tables, allowing for comprehensive sales and business insights.

## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema
The project contains three tables:
- **Books** üìñ (Book details, price, stock levels)
- **Customers** üßë (Customer details, location, contact info)
- **Orders** üõí (Purchase transactions, total amount spent)

## üîß Technologies Used
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)**
- **ETL (Data Import using COPY command)**
- **Data Analysis & Aggregation**

## üìÇ Files in this Repository
- `schema.sql` ‚Üí Creates the database tables
- `data_import.sql` ‚Üí Imports CSV data into tables
- `queries.sql` ‚Üí SQL queries for insights & analysis

## üîç Key Insights
‚úÖ **Top-selling book genres** and most frequently ordered books
‚úÖ **Customer spending trends** and high-value customers
‚úÖ **Real-time stock tracking** after sales fulfillment
‚úÖ **Total revenue generated** for business performance
